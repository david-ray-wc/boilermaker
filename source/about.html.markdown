**Boilermaker: a Bourbon-themed boilerplate**

This is a free tool that I've made to easily start new projects with the Bourbon Bitters and Neat family.

In order to use this, see below:

<pre>$ git clone git@bitbucket.org:dayray023/boilermaker.git your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ bundle install
$ git remote rm origin
$ middleman -p 3030
</pre>
